# Croatian Word Frequency List

## Summary
A list of the most frequently used words and lemmas in the Croatian language. 

## Purpose
The 2,500 most common words from the combined word frequency lists are used to produce a deck of Anki SRS cards [16]. The cards are utilized in the Refold learning methodology [17]

## Sources
This word frequency list was compiled from two main corpus. 
- Croatian news websites [1]
- OpenSubtitles [2]

This gives a mixture of both written and spoken words. Subtitles are often translations of speech from another language but will have to suffice until a corpus of spoken Croatian is sourced.

## Methodology

The word frequncy lists have had these items removed:
- Non Ijekavian words
- Personal names
-	English cognates
-	Abbreviations
-	Units of measurement
-	Interjections
-	Cardinal numbers
-	Ordinal numbers
-	Days
-	Months
-	Currencies 
-	Place names
-	Residencies
-	Colloquialisms
-	Brands
-	Sports teams
-	Sports terminology
-	Organizations
-	Onomatopoeia
